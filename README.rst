AI Assurance Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are building a platform for data science labs to do work in a manner compliant with AI Assurance standards. It is currently pre-alpha.


What It Currently Includes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A preliminary Kubernetes Helm chart for [MLFlow](https://www.mlflow.org), an open source tool for managing and auditing the machine learning lifecycle.
* The Docker containers from DoD Platform One's IronBank for building MLFlow in a hardened manner.


Future Work
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Integrate more with DoD Platform One's work.
* Automation everywhere and an install manual.

Please contribute if you can. Help is always helpful.
