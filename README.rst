AI Assurance Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are building a reference platform for data science labs to do work in a manner compliant with AI Assurance standards. This is for our own internal experimentation at this point, but the hope is to have some kind of reproducible system.


What It Currently Includes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The Docker containers from DoD Platform One's IronBank for building MLFlow in a hardened manner.
* In general a system for easily building IronBank containers locally.
* The NSCA Helm charts, which we are investigating as our primary chart repository.

Future Work
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Integrate more with DoD Platform One's work.
* Automation everywhere and an install manual.

Please contribute if you can. Help is always helpful.
